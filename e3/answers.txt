1.
In my case, I found that both LOESS and Kalman smoothing were pretty close for smoothing the CPU temperature. However, carefully looking at the smoothing, 
I feel I got better results with Kalman smoothing. LOESS smoothing achieved more smoothing curves compared to Kalman smoothing. I believe this happened
because Kalman smoothing is more sensitive towards outliers, which indicates it gives a better prediction than LOESS smoothing.

2.
I believe that knowing the accelerometer and gyroscope reading would be beneficial for a better prediction about the next latitude and longitude because
it would have helped us to make a better Kalman filter. Besides, with those readings, I could have made a better transition matrix, which would have helped
me create a better Kalman filter, which would be more perfect to predict.
