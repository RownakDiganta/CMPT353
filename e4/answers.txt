1. 
Based on my results for the last question, I think that daily temperatures are not that much of an excellent way to predict population density.
As seen in the plots, there is no clear trend between the two. From 15°C to 20°C, there are many outliers visible, which makes it hard to predict results.
Also, below 15°C population density seems lower than above, but again, above 25°C  doesn’t reduce the population density much.
However, between 15°C and 25°C, population density appears to be increasing from both sides.

The method described in the question might be faster than working with uncompressed .json or .csv data because compressed data are more minor in size,
which makes the reading data work easier as there is less data to read from. This speeds up I/O operations. Also, as it needs less storage, 
it catches data efficiently and reduces disk reads by a grand scale.
