I used NumPy and Pandas to do np_summary.py and pd_summary.py, where from question no. 1 to question no. 3, I  Pretty much used the same calculation.
The only difference while doing those calculations was that while working with NumPy, I used numpy arrays, and while working with Pandas, I used data frames.
Otherwise, both steps were the same.

I felt pretty much the same while working with both libraries. However, I felt a little bit better working with Pandas because of the visual representation of
the data. The visual representation of data in Pandas was great because of the added labels. It was helpful for me as while coding, I could quickly keep track
of the types of data I was working with, thanks to the labels.

Both codes have the same level of readability. But, for beginners, I think they might find pandas a little bit better on the getting data part 
(commented in my code) of the code.

For me, running time for pivot_months_pandas was 8.94 ms ± 735 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each) and for pivot_months_loops was
300 ms ± 2.38 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each).

The differences are visible because of the implementation of both functions. In pivot_months_pandas, I used builted in functions of Pandas library which is 
really fast while being executed. On the other hand, in pivot_months_loops, a lot of loops were present which takes a lot of time to be executed. Hence, 
the conclusion is function implemented using Pandas is faster than a similar fucntion which uses loops.
