1.
In my case, when I used np.sqrt() out of four suggested transformations, I got the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test.

2. 
For the original T-test, if I would reject the null hypothesis, it would mean that there is a difference in the total number of comments 
posted on Reddit by users on weekdays compared to weekends.
For the transformed data T-test, I would reject the null hypothesis. It would mean that even after considering the skewness of the distribution
and adjusting it, there is still a difference in the total number of comments posted on weekdays compared to weekends. Hence, one might want to reconsider 
the distribution of data to come to a conclusion in this case.

3.
Out of four approaches, fix 2 (the central limit theorem might save us)  did a better job of getting the answer. Because it was the only
test where I got a p-value >0.5, and for this reason, the null hypothesis wasn't rejected. However, in the other cases, the null hypothesis was rejected.
Besides, we combined all weekdays and weekends to find the result in this case, which gives us the chance to get a better result.

4.
In my analysis, I found that on weekdays, more Reddit comments are posted in /r/canada on average. However, we should also consider that
weekdays are five days in total, and weekends are two days in total. This fact might be something to think about while considering the question.
