1.
The p-value which I got in my case is 2.607038813965922e-127 which is really a small value. However, it is not zero. By looking at the plot and OLS p-value, 
I believe that it is close to being normal and the ratings are increasing pretty much.

2.
Yes, in my case the new 'better' prediction is letting the kalman filter do a better job capturing the true signal in the noise. I believe that is is because 
of doing a better feature representation in this case.
