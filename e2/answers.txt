1.
The result of the calculation data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept is mainly the values of the last column prediction (In my code's final data frame).
These values are used for producing the best fit line for Extracted_df_2['created_at'] against Extracted_df_2['prediction'] scatter plot (In my code).
Which gives us a better view of the data analysis of the tweets.

The data type is float (To be exact, float64 in my case), and the values are made from the fit variable, which is mainly a value generated by using
scipy.stats.linregress on the values of timestamp(as x coordinate) and rating(as x coordinate). The values are important because it helps us to get the 
best fit line for the scatter plot of the tweets.

2.
In the same hint, it produces a fit line on the graph because it is the result of linear regression function which gives us a proper predicted line in the
scatter plot. Also, we used timestamp because it is not in datatime value. For getting a proper linear regression we need numeric value. Hence, created_at
values are converted to seconds and these values are timestamp values. This is the reason why the hint produces fit line.

The created_at values are datatime type and timestamp values are numeric type(float64 in my case). For the fit line we need numeric value and for the
points on the scatter plot we need created_at values. Also, timestamp values are generated from created_at values. This is the reason why they are 
paired correctly to make points on the plot.
