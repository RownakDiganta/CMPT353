1. 
In my case, the random forests classifier gave me the best colour prediction which is 0.757(for rgb) and  0.760(for converted value). 
I think it is because of it is an ensemble of decision tress and it is always better than a single decision tree model. RGB, LAB, HSV have 
different parameters to define a particular colour. In my case, different machine learning models gave me separate value for RGB and LAB.
Which indicates that machine learning models might give better prediction based on how the colour is defined. For me, in all cases I got better results
in LAB than RGB. I didn't use HSV. I think LAB gave me better results as it's parameters perceptual lightness and unique colours of human vision were more
suitable for predicting data. 

2. 
In my case, I feel like the model I used is making reasonable mistakes because the accuracy score of my model, which I last ran,
showed 0.7344827586206897, which means my model will give me predictions which would be approximately 73.4% correct.
Adding more features like more precise information regarding climates in disastrous situations would be helpful because this information is unique
for a particular place. Also, features like temperature differences from summer to winter would be beneficial.
